# Unitum

Unitum is a Discord bot designed to foster collaboration and learning among junior developers through code reviews. It aims to break down barriers and provide a platform for junior developers to share their projects and receive constructive feedback from their peers.


## Features

*- Code Review Requests:* Users can request code reviews by using the !request command in the designated "code-review" channel. They need to provide the programming language and a link to their GitHub repository.

*- Language-specific Channels:* The bot sends a message to the corresponding language channel, notifying users about a code review request in their language. This helps in organizing and streamlining the code review process.

*- Reviewer Feedback:* Reviewers can react to the code review request message with a checkmark emoji and provide their feedback in the message thread. This encourages active participation and engagement from the community.

*- Review Points and Milestones:* Users earn review points for completing code reviews. When they reach predefined milestones, the bot awards them with medals as a recognition of their contributions to the community.

*- Encouragement and Support:* The bot sends messages of thanks and encouragement to users who complete code reviews, motivating them to continue supporting fellow developers.
